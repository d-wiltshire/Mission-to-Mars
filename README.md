# Mission-to-Mars

The purpose of this project was to create a web app that scrapes web data regarding the planet Mars and populates the information onto a new webpage. For this challenge, BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, and the scraped data was stored on a Mongo database. Flask and Bootstrap were then used to create a web application to display the data in an attractive and responsive format.

## Deliverable 1: Scrape High-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
The first deliverable involved scraping full-resolution images and titles from the page https://marshemispheres.com/ and adding these to a Python dictionary.

## Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
The second deliverable involved adding the above information to a Mongo database and displaying that on a web application. The images and titles were populated at the bottom of the page seen here without additional Bootstrap styling:
  
## Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
The third deliverable involved adding Bootstrap styling to various aspects of the web application. The style elements adjusted include:

* button color changed
* hemisphere images at bottom made responsive;
* "Mars Facts" title size change and centered in column
